title: PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser
---

A fast, simple and reliable HTML document parser for PHP.

The original [Simple HTML DOM Parser project](https://sourceforge.net/p/simplehtmldom) was created by S.C. Chen, based on [HTML Parser for PHP 4](http://php-html.sourceforge.net/) by Jose
Solorzano.

It is now being continued here by PHPCore aiming to make "composer" compatibility better and clean-up some code, introduce type-safety and generally keep the project up-to-date.

# Parse any HTML document

PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser handles any HTML document, even ones that are considered
invalid by the [HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/) specification.

# Select elements using CSS selectors

PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser supports CSS style selectors to navigate the DOM,
similar to [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).
